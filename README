Course Project of Compilers (2013 fall)
===================================================================

This is a small compiler constructed using PLY (python-lex-yacc) and HLA (high level assembler).

This compiler generates x86 ELF that can be executed on Linux. With appropriate setup of HLA, it can also be executed on other platforms.

Examples of this DLang can be found in the `example` folder.


Currently using PLY here (http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/).
